# Natural-Language-Processing-in-social-media
This project done on jupyter notebook analysis the sentiments of 31k-41k tweets. Various steps involved are:tokenization,data cleaning,removal of stop words,classification,scoring and calculation. Wordcloud is used for easy visualization of the words. Accuracy of the model is predicted as 94.69%.

# Problem Statement:
Sentimental Analysis using Python to determine the polarity and nature of tweets 
data and classify them as Positive,Neutral or Negative.

## Introduction:
Sentimental analysis is a natural language processing text mining technique 
that uses mathematics and other machine learning tools to determine 
the emotional meaning of communications. Natural language processing is used
to determine sentiments of human understandable languages as a computer cannot understand human languages directly.
Some points to remember is:
-> Key aspects of a specific product and service that are important to customers.
-> Consumers intentions and reactions about those aspects.
Sentimental analysis is used in many domains like education, healthcare, various organizations etc. It is used to connect more strongly to the society and organizations. 

### Methodology Used:
-> TOKENIZATION <br>
-> DATA CLEANING <br>
-> REMOVE THE STOP WORDS <br>
-> CLASSIFICATION AND SCORING  <br>
-> CALCULATION <br>

# Result & Conclusion:
The sentiments of the tweets is successfully analyzed with 0.94 accuracy and finally the graphs are plotted between the root words extracted from the tweets and their count or the frequency. Various modules of the python is imported like pandas, numpy, matplotlib.pyplot, seaborn etc. The re module is to check for the similar patterns occurring in the data. The warnings which can be generated are ignored using warning.filterwarnings(‘ignore’).Logistic Regression is used to predict the result using the previous information from data. Using word cloud those words are generated which are given 0 as positive label and 1 as negative label.
The graph shows the relation between the particular hashtag and its frequency of first the positive words and then of the negative hashtags. The sentiments of the tweets is judged by knowing the frequency of each positive and negative hashtags and then comparing the count from every graph.
